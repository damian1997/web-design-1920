## Description
For this project i designed a solution for Larissa Klaassen.
Larissa Klaassen has limited eye sight and cannot see much, to read websites she uses a screenreader to consume the content.
Larissa is a professional athlete and for her training she gets a roster from her coach, this roster is made in excel and this is unreadable for Larissa.

### Case
Understanding a professional athlete's roster.

**Description**
For this project we need to design a solution for Larissa so she can consume the most important information that she needs on a day to day basis, and
if she has anything to do during the coming weekend and the days following.

## Week 1
During the first week we had a meeting with Larissa and we asked her some questions to get to know her better. Larissa rides the tandem
because of her limited eye sight she rides on the back seat. She also is a student in the computer science field.

In order to understand her roster she gets from her coach she sits down with a colleague professional athlete and go through the roster. She does this
every time she gets a new roster. After sitting down with her colleague she knows most of the things that are listed on the roster but not everything.
After going through the roster with her colleague and taking notes on it she never opens the excel sheet again because this is not readable for her and her screenreader.

After this introduction we asked her what she finds the most important information, she said:
* In which phase she is in (e.g. Hypertrophy)
* Important matches
* Training camps
* Training schedule and which location

We also asked her what websites she uses that are great to go through with her screenreader, she said that she realy likes the way the NS (dutch railway company)
structures their information. They do this by bundling the information in small blocks and not hiding information in long sentences, this way she gets the information
she wants very quickly and does not have to search for it.

### Hobby's
We also asked Larissa some personal questions, she told us that she really likes to read books using her braille reader. She also is into riding horses.
